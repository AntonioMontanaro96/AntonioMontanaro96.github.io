        <h2>Hi, I am Antonio Montanaro and this is my 3D-AI digital art portfolio</h2>
        <h2>My philosophy</h2>
        I am an AI Research Scientist with a passion for physics, 3D graphics, and music animations,<br>
         always exploring what stimulate the visual cortex of the brain and the human emotions.<br>
        I get inspiration from the laws of nature, powered by the synergy of human creativity and artificial intelligence.<br><br>
        
        Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re curious to learn more, collaborate, or bring some of this digital art into your world.<br><br>

        <h2>Follow the Flow</h2>
        <p id="Follow the Flow">
        "Follow the Flow" is an art installation that merges creativity and artificial intelligence<br>
         into 
        an immersive sensory experience. The work is built on a large-scale fluid simulation, <br>
        where particle motion follows natural and sonic dynamics, generating a hypnotic, organic flow.<br>
        The color of the particles is driven by AI-generated video, forming a constantly evolving visual palette.<br>
        The interplay between data, fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence creates a digital landscape<br>
         where order and chaos, nature and technology, coexist in a continuous dialogueâ€”an endless flow of transformation.<br>

        <h2>3D sculpting</h2>
        Blending human creativity with machine intelligence,<br> 
        this process uses AI-assisted tools to enhance 3D sculpting in Blenderâ€”speeding up workflows,<br> 
        generating concept shapes, and unlocking new forms of artistic expression.<br>
        New video generative models can then animate this contents.<br><br>

        <h2>Method Overview</h2>
        <p id="methodoverview">
            We propose a novel zero-shot video generation method, named MotionCraft, where an image (real or generated),
            serving as a starting frame $I^0$, is animated according to a physical simulation, by means of a (possibly
            time-varying) optical-flow generator $\mathcal{W}$ in the noise latent space. The outcome is a video made of
            $N$ frames $I^0,\dots,I^{N-1}$ that follows the motion prescribed by the physical simulation and evolves the
            content of the first frame coherently. Inspired by the previous observation, this animation is obtained by
            warping the noisy latent representation of an image in the latent diffusion space. Regarding the physics
            simulation for the optical flow generation, we use different libraries to simulate different physics, as
            explained in the experimental section, such as fluid dynamics, rigid motion and multi-agent systems. It is
            also possible, albeit not shown in this paper, to use animation software to generate the required optical
            flows.
